not that you'd want to recycle this code.

It is known that the < operator does not work, and 
neither do pipes.

for some reason, grep, and wc cause a crash when called
with a pipe.  so be aware.  I'm sure that this is 
because I have not yet figured out a proper way to do
pipes.

otherwise go crazy.
